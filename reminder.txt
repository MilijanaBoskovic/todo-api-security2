User model will contain:
=> email
=>tokens- array of objects-login tokens- different authentication tokens for different devices
          =>access property- will specify token type, we will use only 'auth'
          =>token value-crypted, this is the string we will pass back and foward
                        when user wants to make secure request he will send this along with http request
                        and we will be able to validate that the user has indead access to do what they want to do
                        whether that is adding, deleting or updating the todo

*validating emails: we will use validating library: mongoose custom validation=> custom validators section
                  => first we need to set this atribute to email object in model: validate:{
                                                                                      validator:(value)=>{

                                                                                      },
                                                                                      message:`${valude} is not valid`
                                                                                  }
                  => validators function is called with value we need to validate and returns true if value is valid
                  =>we need to install validator module and use its function inside of validator
                  =>npm install validator@5.6.0 --save
                  =>we need to set tokens atribute also
                  => inside of it we will specify all properties available on a token
                  tokens:[{
                    access:{
                      type: String,
                      required:true
                    },
                    token:{
                      type: String,
                      required:true
                    }
                  }]
=> we need to make post route for login
  app.post('/users',(req,res)=>{
          var body= _.pick(req.body,['email','password']);
          var user= new User(body);
          user.save().then( (user)=>{ res.send(user); }).catch((e)=>{res.status(400).send(e)});
});
=>before doing request in postman we need to turn of server on port 3000 and drop todo database
=>after that we can send some json data to localhost:3000/users from postman
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ATENTION:
validate:{
  validator:(value)=>{
    return validator.isEmail(value);
  },
is the same as we only pass method that should be used like: validator: validator.isEmail
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------
HASHING AND JSON WEB tokens
---------------------------------------
-using this we will be able to set up authentication for our app
-our of our routes are public right now,anybody can hit this and manipulate data
-with authentication this will be private routes meaning you will have to be loged in and manipulate data that you are actually own
=> we will create token system: => we can think about token as a string which is going to be sent back from our signup and login requests
                                => the client is then is going to take this token and use it to authenticate other requests
                                =>it will simple passing along as header to request and it is going to be able to make that call succesfuly after authenticate
HASHING
------------
*we will install module which contains a lot of crypto algorithms: npm i crypto-js@3.1.6 --save
*sha256: all we need to do to hash a value is to pass to sha256 function:
=> var hash=SHA256(some_string).toString();
=>hashing is one way algorithm,meaning giving this message we will always get this result but we cant get original message back if we have result

**we will use hashing in the similar way as sourceforge:
  => which lets you verify that the file you have downloaded is the one you acctually wanted because it hashes the file
  => and shows you hash value, this means you can hash file later if you get the same result you knows that that is the file
  => source forge wanted you to get and if you get the different result oposite and you probably shouldnt use it because it could have viruses inside.
  => this is the exact technique we will use for our token and this is not going to pervent someone in the middle from seeing the value,
  => we will use htttps for that,we will securly transport our tokens.
  => This will however going to pervent someone on the client to gets the value from manipulating the id and changing it to something else
----for example if we send back the token and that token says This is for user number 3. The user than gets the token and change it to user number 4
  =>and tries to delete someone elses data
  =>what we can do is to use hashing to make shure that that value,the id,does not acctualy get changed,if it does
  =>we will be able to spot that change and be able to deny user access because we know that they never actualy get that token from us
  =>they probably created token on their own.

---for example: if we talk about data that we want to send from server to the client
              =>if we have object data with id property with value of 4,which will be equal to the users id from the users collection
              =>this is going to lets us to know which user should be able to make their request
              => for example: if I try to delete the note with id of 3,but the user who created that does not match the id of token
              =>then I know that it shouldnt be able to delete that because it is not their data
              =>if data object is data we want to send to the client
              =>the important part is making shure that the client does not set different id, send the token back to us AND
              =>say hi go ahed and delete all notes for user number 5, that would be big security flow
              =>instead we are going to create separate variable called the token and this we are going to sent to the user
              =>the token variable is going to contain the data property and hash which is going to be hashed value of the data
              =>if the data changes later on and we rehash it we are not going to get same value back so we will be able to tell
              =>that the data was manipulated by the client and we should not expect to be valid
              var data={
                id: 4
              };
              var token={
                data,
                hash: SHA256(JSON.stringify(data)).toString()
              };
  -------------------------------------------
  JWT
  --------------------------------------------
              =>this token is not fullprof,for example,let say that the user changes data id property, all they have to do is rehash
              =>that data,add it on to hash property, send the token back and they tehnicly will trick us
              =>what we are going to do to pervent this is salt the hash=>
              =>it means you add something on to the hash that is unique and changes the value
              =>for example if we hash the string password we are going to get same result every time but if we hash it with some
              =>randomly generated value we will get different result,as long as we use different salt every single time
              =>hash: SHA256(JSON.stringify(data)+ 'somesecret').toString() =>this is going to salt our hash
              =>now the user would not be able to manipulate this data anymore, they could change the id, they could try to rehash
              =>but they are not going to have secret so hash is going to be bad
              =>when then we try to verify the hash later on we will see that and deny access for that request
              =>This principle is the standard called JWT-JSON WEB TOKEN.
              =>there are libraries providing this, https://jwt.io : npm i jsonwebtoken@7.1.9 --save
              =>which we are going to use instead of crypto-js
              =>we get two functions:
              1)to create token: sign- takes the data object, creates hash and returns the token value
              2) to verify it: verify- does the opposite, it takes the token and the secret and makes shure that the data is not manipulated
                            var token= jwt.sign(data,'123abc');
                            console.log(token);
                            var decoded=jwt.verify(token,'123abc');
                            console.log(decoded);
-------------------------------------------
INTEGRATION TO PROJECT
--------------------------------------------
*in post users currently we are not returning authentication token,the user need to sign up and then use separate log in request
 *we will explore module and instance methods for getting authentication done
 1.model methods-are called on uppercase User object,they dont require individual document
                 ---for example: User.findByToken- will take jwt token that the user sends in secure request, we will find individual user
                                                   and we will return that user to the caller
 2.instance methods-are called on individual user
                   ---for example: user.generateAuthToken- which will add token upon individual user document saving that and
                                                           returning the token so we can send it back to the user
 *UserSchema.mehods is object on which we can add any method we want and this are going to be instance methods
                    =>instance methods have acces to individual documents, and we need that information in order to create JWT
                    =>we will use regular functions beacuse arrow functions dont bind this keyword, and we need this keyword for our methods
                    =>because this keyword stores individual document
---for example:
                    UserSchema.methods.generateAuthToken= function()
                    {
                      var user=this;

                      var access='auth';
                      var token= jwt.sign({_id: user._id.toHexString(), access},'abc123').toString();

                      user.tokens.concat([{access,token}]);

                      return user.save()
                                    .then(()=>{
                                        return token;
                                        });
                    };
                    => sign function accepts two arguments and returns object:
                         => first argument of sign function is object that has the data we want to sign
                         => second argument is some secret value
                    => after that we need to update tokens array, we need to push this new object with those two properties
                    => now we have changes made to a user model and at last we need to save those changes
                    => currently we update local user model but we dont save it
                    => user.save returns promise in then we can pass success callback function and return token
                    => we will do this so later in the server file we can grab the token by adding other then callback getting access
                    =>to the token and then responding inside a callback function
                    =>in order to allow server.js to chain on the promise we will return all statement user.save()....
                    => and the value o token will be passed as the success argument for the next then call
  => now we can generate token by calling the method and add it as header in server.js:

  app.post('/users',(req,res)=>{

    var body= _.pick(req.body,['email','password']);
    var user= new User(body);

    user.save()
      .then( ()=>
      {
        return user.generateAuthToken(); //we are returning because we want chaining
      })
      .then((token)=>
      {
        res.header('x-auth','token').send(user); //we want to send token in http header
      })                                         //header has two arguments which are key/value pairs where key is header name and the value is the value you want to set header to, when you prefix header name with x- it means we are creating custom header
      .catch((e)=>
      {
        res.status(400).send(e)
      });
  });
-----------------------------------------
* if we want to limit data we sent back,when we convert some of our instances into json value
=>there is toJSON method available that we can acctualy override which means we can only sent back certan values
=>we dont want to send back to the user secure properties as password or tokens

UserSchema.methods.toJSON=function()
{
  var user=this;
  var userObject=user.toObject();
  return _.pick(userObject,['_id','email']);
};
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PRIVATE routes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*This means that we will require x-auth token, validate that token, find the user associated with that token
 and then and only then you will be able to run the route code
 *we will add express middleware wich will done all of that verification and authentication for us

*we will make new route to url /users/me and  we will use http get method to access
=> this route will require authentication which means you need to provide valid x-auth token
=>it is going to find associated user and it is going to send that user back

  UserSchema.statics.findByToken= function(token){  //.statics -everything you add on it become model method
    var User=this;                                  //in case of model methods this is relay on model not instance
    var decoded;
    try
    {
      decoded= jwt.verify(token, 'abc123');         //verify will throw a error if token value was manipulated or secrets doesnt match
    }
    catch(e)
    {
      // return new Proise((resolve,reject)=>{ reject();});  //we will return the promise which will always get rejected to servers catch catch it
      return Promise.reject();                               //this is the same
    }
    return User.findOne({                           //if we access to succesfuly decode token we will try to find associated user
      _id: decoded._id,
      'tokens.token': token,                       //when we use nested documents in query we need ''
      'tokens.access':'auth'
    });
};

app.get('users/me',(req,res)=>{

  var token=req.header('x-auth'); //header method on request has only key argument- name of header

  User.findByToken(token).then((user)=>{
    if(!user)                              //it might be null if there is no user who passed the query
    {
      return Promise.reject();            //it will also be catched by chatch(e)
    }
    res.send(user);
  })
  .catch(e)=>{
    res.status(401).send();   //401-authentication has failed
  };
});

*we need to send request to /user/me and in headers section we need to provide token x-auth with some valid token from database
-----------------------------
authentication middleware
------------------------------
*we want all of our routes use it, we will use it on our routes to make them private
*actual route will not be called until next is called in middleware

var authenticate=(req,res,next)=>{
  var token=req.header('x-auth');

  User.findByToken(token).then((user)=>{
    if(!user)
    {
      return Promise.reject();
    }
    req.user=user;                          //we will modify request object so we can use it inside of route
    req.token=token;
    next();
  }).catch((e)=>{
    res.status(401).send();                 //we will not call next because we dont want to call app.get in case of error
  });
};
app.get('/users/me',authenticate,(req,res)=>{  //to add a middleware we simply reference function as argument

  res.send(req.user);
});
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HASHING PASSWORDS BEFORE SENDING THEM TO DATABASE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*we will validate plain text version,then we will hash it,salt it and store it in a database
=>we will use algorithm called bcrypt - it has salting built in : npm package
=> npm i bcryptjs@2.3.0 --save
*we need to call 3 methods:
1) genSalt - this will generate salt which we will use to salt our password:
 *it takes two arguments and it is async method
  1) num of rounds you want to use to generate the salt
  2) callback function which takes err and salt in which we will do the hashing
  ---for example:
                  bcrypt.genSalt(10,(err, salt)=>{

                    bcrypt.hash(password,salt, (err,hash)=>{

                    });
                  });
2) hash method: takes three arguments:
    1)thing we want to hash
    2)salt to use
    3)callback function with err and the hash value which we want to store in our database
3) compare function:takes three arguments
  1) plain text password
  2) hashed password
  3) callback function with res and err where res is true if they are match

  bcrypt.compare(pass,hashedPassword,(err,res)=>{
      console.log(res);
  });
=> we want to add this in our user file =>we need mongoose middleware
=> it lets you run certain code before or after certain events, for example update event- we can run some code before updating the model
=> in our case we want to run some code before document is saved
=> we need to modify our user Schema:
UserSchema.pre('save',function(next){

  var user=this;                      //we need access to individual document
  if(user.isModified('password'))
  {
    bcrypt.genSalt(10,(err, salt)=>{
      bcrypt.hash(user.password, salt, (err,hash)=>{
        user.password=hash;
      });
    });
    next();
  }
  else
  {    next();  }
});
---------------------------------------------------------
TESTING
---------------------------------------------------------
*for seed database for testing purpose we made seed.js file
ATTENTION:
----------------
const populateUsers=(done)=>
{
  User.remove({}).then(()=>{
    var userOne=new User(users[0]).save(); //save returns promise
    var userTwo=new User(users[1]).save();
    return Promise.all([userOne,userTwo]);
}).then(()=>done());
};
=> we populate users like this because we need save call to trigger event for mongoose middleware
  which we need for hashing passwords
=> after that we use Promise.all function which accepts array of promises and after both being resolved then will be called

=>in server.test.js we : beforeEach(populateUsers); and the same for todos
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*we use request(app).get('/users/me').set('x-auth',users[0].tokens[0].token)... to set the header of request, it takes 2 arguments:
=> name of header as first and value is the second one

*when we are seting post method we need also to send data: request(app).post('/users').send({email,password})...
* when we are checking header we do it like: expect(res.headers['x-auth']).toExist();
  in order to get value we use bracket notation instead of dot one because our header name has - in it
---------------------------------------------
USER LOG IN

*we are creating path for login request, we need to check does user with that email and password exists, so we made function in user model
* function will return rejected promise if user is not found and catch in server will catch it

ATTENTION: all of bcrypt methods only support callbacks, they do not support promises
=>*in case of success we will return new Promise so we can inside use them and still work with promises
=>
UserSchema.statics.findByCredentials= function(email,password)
{
  var User=this;
  return User.findOne({email: email})
    . then((user)=>
      {
        if(!user)
          return Promise.reject();
        return new Promise((resolve,reject)=>
        {
          bcrypt.compare(password,user.password,(err,res)=>
          {
              if(res){ resolve(user);  }
              else   { reject();       }
          });
       });
  });
}


app.post('/users/login',(req,res)=>{
  var body= _.pick(req.body,['email','password']);

  //first we need to verify that user exists-we will use model method for that which will return promise or error=>

  User.findByCredentials(body.email,body.password)          //we dont use if to check does user exists because we are returning reject which is going to be handled by catch block
      .then((user)=>
      {
        return user.generateAuthToken()                     //we need to generate new token and send it back
                   .then((token)=>{                          //we are still using return so that if some error occur catch block catch it
                    res.header('x-auth',token).send(user);
                    });
      })
      .catch((e)=>
      {
        res.status(400).send();
      });
});
------------------------------------------------------------
DELETE /users/me/token ---basicly sign out:

UserSchema.methods.removeToken= function(token)  //we will call update method to update our array
{
  var user=this;
  return user.update({                          //in update function we only passes updates object
    $pull:{                                     //$pull-mongodb operator-remove array elements which matches certain criterium
      tokens:{
        token:token
      }
    }
  });
};
//we are trying to delete token for currently logged in user, token which is used in authentication middleware
//private route

app.delete('/users/me/token',authenticate,(req,res)=>{
  req.user.removeToken(req.token).then(()=>{
    res.status(200).send();
  },()=>{
    res.status(400).send()
  });
});
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
ASSOCIATE TODOS WITH USERS- making todo routes PRIVATE

*at first we need to change todo model by adding property _creator (name which start with _ suggest that the type is ObjectID)
_creator:{
  type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
  require:true
}
*we added authentication middleware to routes, which mean we are going to have access to the user and the token inside of request callback
=> so we can use _id inside of our query:
app.post('/todos',authenticate,(req,res)=>
{
  console.log(req.body);

  var todo= new Todo({
       text : req.body.text,

EXPECT UPGRADE

* mjakson expect -old
* jest expect -  new
*npm i expect@21.1.0 --save-dev
*we need to change some methods:
ATTENTION: We should remember that expect library is only responsible for expect calls inside except callback function where we use global except variable
           Other expect calls, where we use except method are coming from supertest which not have changed.
* toExist is replaced with toBeTruthy
* toNotExist is replaced with toBeFalsy
=> in difference of old methods these ones returns error in case the condition is not fulfield
*toBeA --there is no equivalent=> we have to replace it with toBe and typeof:
                  expect(res.body.todo.completedAt).toBeA('number');    <==>
                  expect(typeof res.body.todo.completedAt).toBe('number');
*toNotBe -- there is no equivalent, we will use instead .not() which is ment to be used with expect(...).not.toBe()

*toInclude---toMatchObject(object) which expects that one object contains all of the properties from another,
             object passed as parametar is subset of object that we made expect from
             =>old expect version was able to correctly parse out all of the stuff from mongoose that is on user,
                new version is going to throw the error => we will use toObject() function on user, that will return raw user data=>

                User.findById(users[1]._id).then((user)=>{
                  expect(user.tokens[1]).toInclude({
                    access:'auth',
                    token: res.headers['x-auth']
                  });

                  User.findById(users[1]._id).then((user)=>{
                    expect(user.toObject().tokens[1]).toMatchObject({
                      access:'auth',
                      token: res.headers['x-auth']
                    });
